# Multiple-Linear-Regression-

I am very excited to share with you a simple multiple linear regression project with Python Using Python programming, 
I create  and test multiple linear regression models.  Then, Using sciket-learn and pandas,  
I can calculate the regression and manage data. 
Also, using scikit-learn, I learn to build  multivariate and univariate linear regression.  
Besides, I build plots  and data visualizations using matplotlib. 
By the end of this linear regression project,  I've learned many practical  skill sets that will be useful in the real world.
